## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Still Count immobility analysis tool:

---

### 1️⃣ Open a command prompt / terminal

- **Windows:** Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.  
- **Mac:** Open **Terminal** from Applications → Utilities.  
- **Linux:** Open your favorite terminal.

### 2️⃣ Clone the repository (or download the ZIP directly from Github)

In the command prompt or terminal, if you have Git installed, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulagsotres/Still_Count.git
```

---

### 3️⃣ Go to the project folder

In the command prompt or terminal, type:

```bash
cd "Still_Count"
````

- cd means change directory → it moves the terminal into the folder where the project is.
- You need to be inside the project folder to run the code or install packages.

---

4️⃣ (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment

A virtual environment keeps the project dependencies separate from other Python projects.

python -m venv venv

Activate it:

- Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

- Mac / Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

You should now see (venv) in your terminal – this means the environment is active.
