## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Still Count immobility analysis tool:


### 1️⃣ Open a command prompt / terminal in the folder you want to store Still Count

- **Windows:** Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.  
- **Mac:** Open **Terminal** from Applications → Utilities.  
- **Linux:** Open your favorite terminal.

### 2️⃣ Clone the repository (or download the ZIP directly from Github)

In the command prompt or terminal, if you have Git installed, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulagsotres/Still_Count.git
```


### 3️⃣ (Optional but recommended) Create a new environment in using Conda

A virtual environment keeps the project dependencies separate from other Python projects. In your terminal type:
```bash
conda create -n still_count
```
Activate it:
```bash
conda activate still_count
```
You should now see (still_count) in your conda environments – this means the environment is active.



### 4️⃣ Install dependencies

With the environment active, open the terminal and run:
``` bash
cd folder\Still_Count
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5️⃣ Open GUI

Run the GUI:
``` bash
python run_gui.py
```

Next time you want to open GUI the steps are directly:
``` bash
conda activate still_count
cd folder\Still_Count
python run_gui.py
```
